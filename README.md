## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 19/09/2025
# Reg. No. 212222210020


**Aim**

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image (sports bike and bicycle) by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the images and use these details to generate images as close as possible to the originals.

**Procedure**

Image 1: KTM Sports Bike

**Analyze the Image:**
Objects/Subjects: KTM sports bike (orange rims, white-black body).

Colors: Dominant hues: white, black, orange; background: green grass, trees.

Textures: Glossy metal, smooth tires, rough outdoor road.

Lighting: Bright, natural daylight.

Background: Outdoor, open area with greenery and fence.

Composition: Bike at center, angled view.

Style: Realistic photography.

**Basic Prompt:
**“A sports motorbike parked on an open road.”

**Refined Prompt:
**“A KTM sports bike with orange wheels and a white-black body parked on an outdoor road, background with green grass and trees, captured in bright daylight.”

Final Prompt (with Style):
“A realistic photograph of a KTM sports bike with orange rims and a white-black body, standing on a paved road, background with green grass, trees, and a fence, under clear daylight.”

**Image 2: City Bicycle**

**Analyze the Image**
Objects/Subjects: Person riding a city bicycle (casual wear, sneakers).

Colors: Dominant hues: blue jeans, black bicycle, brown tires.

Textures: Smooth tires, metallic frame, fabric clothes.

Lighting: Bright, natural sunlight.

Background: Outdoor, leafy street, blurred trees.

Composition: Side view of cyclist, focus on bicycle and lower half of rider.

Style: Realistic outdoor photography.

Basic Prompt:
“A person riding a bicycle on a street.”

Refined Prompt:
“A person wearing blue jeans and white sneakers riding a black city bicycle with light-brown tires, on an outdoor street with trees in the background, in bright daylight.”

Final Prompt (with Style):
“A realistic photograph of a person riding a city bicycle with brown tires and a black frame, wearing blue jeans and white sneakers, on a tree-lined street in natural sunlight.”

Tools/LLMs for Image Generation

DALL·E (OpenAI): For realistic AI reproductions.

Stable Diffusion: For detailed control and customization.

MidJourney: For visually creative outputs.

Prompts Used

Image 1 (Bike): “A realistic photograph of a KTM sports bike with orange rims and a white-black body, standing on a paved road, background with green grass, trees, and a fence, under clear daylight.”

Image 2 (Bicycle): “A realistic photograph of a person riding a city bicycle with brown tires and a black frame, wearing blue jeans and white sneakers, on a tree-lined street in natural sunlight.”

Comparison Report

Image 1: The generated bike should replicate the orange rims and white-black body, with similar daylight and outdoor setting. Minor variations may occur in background or detailing.

Image 2: The generated bicycle should capture jeans, sneakers, black frame, brown tires, and sunny street background. Differences may occur in rider posture or surrounding trees.

Conclusion

By carefully analyzing the original images and crafting precise prompts, the AI-generated outputs can closely replicate the real-world visuals. The KTM sports bike and city bicycle examples highlight the role of iterative refinement and detail in achieving realistic reproductions. This experiment shows that prompt engineering is critical to bridging human perception and AI creativity.
